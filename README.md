# XSLTrafo Thingworx Extensions #
This repo hosts two Thingworx Extensions:
 1. The [XSLTrafoResource Extension](XSLTrafoResource) is a Thingworx Extension that adds a Resource 
    with a Javascript Snippet to transform XML via XSL
 2. The [XSLTrafoResource_Examples Extension](XSLTrafoResourceExample) has examples on how to use the XSLTrafoResource Extension.
 
The Thingworx importable packages of these two extensions is available from the [Releases section](../../releases).

For convenience I also added a command-line version __XSLTrafoCmd__ that uses the same (java default) XSL processor. 
A runnable jar of it is added to the  [Releases section](../../../releases) as well.
